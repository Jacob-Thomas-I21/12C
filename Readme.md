# TwelveC (12C) – AI-Powered Carbon Intelligence System

**TwelveC** (short for Carbon-12) is a full-stack machine learning engine that estimates, explains, optimizes, and forecasts carbon emissions using real-world energy, economic, and environmental indicators.

Designed to support ESG analysts, policymakers, and organizations aiming for net-zero goals, TwelveC turns fragmented datasets into actionable carbon insights through a hybrid AI stack.

## Problem Statement

Despite the global urgency of climate action, carbon emissions data remains **fragmented, outdated, and non-actionable**. Enterprises and governments lack a centralized, explainable system to estimate and optimize emissions in real time.

**TwelveC solves this** by combining ML estimators, explainability engines, and simulation layers to provide both accuracy and clarity.

##  Dataset Source

- **Our World in Data (OWID) – CO₂ and Greenhouse Gas Emissions**  
  [GitHub Repository »](https://github.com/owid/co2-data)

This open-access dataset provides yearly global, country-level carbon emissions, energy use, and GHG breakdowns.  
Data was cleaned, pivoted, and restructured into a machine learning-friendly format for both tabular models and time-series forecasting.
